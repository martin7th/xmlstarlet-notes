# xmlstarlet-notes

`xmlstarlet` ([xmlstar.sf.net](http://xmlstar.sourceforge.net/ "xmlstarlet on SourceForge")) 
is the no-nonsense XML multitool that lets you write simple queries or 
edits on the command line, avoids most of the stylesheet formal stuff, 
and gives your `<o/><o/>`-looking eyes a moment of relief. 
It's also a cranky minimalist tool which targets the 1.0 versions of 
XPath / XSLT / EXSLT still widely used and, it seems, users with little 
need for documentation.

This is an edited version of my personal notes on `xmlstarlet` with 
worked examples -- knowledge gained as an outsider through use, trial 
and error -- focusing on the `select` and `edit` commands and EXSLT. 
It's not a tutorial or a FAQ, it requires a grasp of XML tools and 
the POSIX shell.
